										<h2 class="major">About myself</h2>
										<p>My name is Zichun Wang. I was born in a small town in China. Looking back on the past 22 years, my life has been a mixture of both bitterness and sweetness. During the first 19 years of my life in China, I was well taken care of. Overall, I would describe my pre-20s self as a fledgling nurtured under the wings of parents and society, about to embark on my first flight.</p>

										<h2 class="major">In Calgary</h2>
										<p>After undergoing quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, when I arrived in Calgary in 2021, everything felt profoundly different - the culture, the language, the way of life. However, after three years of living here, I have gradually adapted to life in this new environment.</p>
										<p>Kinesiology has provided me with a diverse range of experiences. I used to consider myself someone who enjoys solitude, not particularly fond of exercise or socializing. However, the motto of Kinesiology is "Active Living," and over these three years, I have gradually started to engage in fitness activities, make more friends, and acquire knowledge that will benefit me for a lifetime.</p>

										<p>P.S. After completing the KNES 237 - Nutrient course, I began paying strict attention to my diet. I make sure to consume fresh vegetables every day. LOL</p>

										<h2 class="major">Volunteering</h2>
										<p>I have participated in two volunteer programs within the UoC, Rehab & Fitness Program -- tailored specifically for individuals with chronic physical disabilities -- and the JointEffort Program -- targets individuals with hip or knee osteoarthritis.</p>
										<p>During interactions with individuals here, I always encounter fascinating discoveries. What astonishes me is that, even though one participant suffers from osteoarthritis, she shared her skiing experiences with me. She even taught me a considerable amount of basic skiing knowledge.</p>
