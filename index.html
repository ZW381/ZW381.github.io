										<h2 class="major">About myself</h2>
										<p>My name is Zichun Wang. I was born in a small town in China. Looking back on the past 22 years, my life has been a mixture of both bitterness and sweetness. During the first 19 years of my life in China, I was well taken care of. Overall, I would describe my pre-20s self as a fledgling nurtured under the wings of parents and society, about to embark on my first flight.</p>

										<h2 class="major">In Calgary</h2>
										<p>After undergoing quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, when I arrived in Calgary in 2021, everything felt profoundly different - the culture, the language, the way of life. However, after three years of living here, I have gradually adapted to life in this new environment.</p>
										<p>Kinesiology has provided me with a diverse range of experiences. I used to consider myself someone who enjoys solitude, not particularly fond of exercise or socializing. However, the motto of Kinesiology is "Active Living," and over these three years, I have gradually started to engage in fitness activities, make more friends, and acquire knowledge that will benefit me for a lifetime.</p>

										<p>P.S. After completing the KNES 237 - Nutrient course, I began paying strict attention to my diet. I make sure to consume fresh vegetables every day. LOL</p>

										<h2 class="major">Volunteering</h2>
										<p>I have participated in two volunteer programs within the UoC, Rehab & Fitness Program--tailored specifically for individuals with chronic physical disabilities--and the JointEffort Program--targets individuals with hip or knee osteoarthritis.</p>
										<p>During interactions with individuals here, I always encounter fascinating discoveries. What astonishes me is that, even though one participant suffers from osteoarthritis, she shared her skiing experiences with me. She even taught me a considerable amount of basic skiing knowledge.</p>

															<h2 class="major">KNES 381</h2>
															<p>When I first heard about KNES 381, I was truly surprised. I never imagined that there would be a computer-related course in Kinesiology. I signed up for this course when it was first offered last year, but unfortunately, I was placed on the waitlist, just one spot away from getting into the class. So, I am here again.</p>
															<p>I am very happy and honored to participate in the KNES 381 course. It has allowed me to see the current and future integration of kinesiology and information technology applications. Whether it's using video analysis software (Dartfish) to study athletes' movements and provide appropriate guidance, or writing essays using code (I used LaTeX to generate APA 7th format, which was incredibly convenient), I have benefited greatly from KNES 381.</p>
